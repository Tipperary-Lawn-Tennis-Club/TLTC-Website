TCLTC want to provide the best possible service. There may be times, however, when you think we could do better and sometimes you may even want to tell us about something we have done well. Whatever age you are, you have rights including:

* The right to have your say and be listened to.
* The right to complain if you are not happy about something we have done.
* We undertake to ensure all complaints are taken seriously and dealt with fairly and confidentially.
* We will endeavor to quickly and informally resolve complaints though discussion with the parents and members of staff as appropriate.

**A Complaint** must be made within 14 days of the date of the alleged incident (save where exceptional circumstances are proven to the satisfaction of the relevant Hearings Committee). It must be in writing. It must refer specifically to an incident(s) and it must specify the Rule (see definition below) allegedly broken.

If a parent/guardian is not satisfied with any aspect of the club they should first of all seek to resolve the issue informally by:

* Discussion with the coach or committee member.
* If the issue is unresolved or reoccurs, they should put their complaint in writing to the Chairperson.
* The Chairperson will then nominate a committee member to meet with the parents and manager/leader (as appropriate) to try and resolve the issue at minimum by the next working week.
* Written records of discussion and agreements made will be kept of this meeting and copies made available to parents, manager/leader, or other involved staff (as appropriate).

If the issue remains unresolved, it may be necessary to from a hearing committee to mediate the complaint.

* The Hearings Committee shall deal with all Complaints, Disciplinary Action and Objections as these are defined in the Tennis Ireland Complaints, Objections & Disciplinary Rules and Procedures.
