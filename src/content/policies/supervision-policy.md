TCLTC Club is proud of the welcome and support given to its Junior members of all ages. The Club encourages all members to make full use of its facilities as often as possible. As part of its obligations regarding the protection of children, the club sets out in this document the details of adequate adult supervision of junior members provided by the club.

The club will ensure that all children’s activities organized by the club will be adequately supervised by adults. Good practice dictates that more than one adult is present to supervise these activities. This will help to ensure the safety of the children as well as protect adults. In this regard the club will be guided by the recommendations contained within.

As a minimum, all club-organized activities will be supervised by one male and one female adult. Adult supervisors will ensure that they are not left alone with young participants. If an adult needs to talk separately to a child, this will be done in an open environment, in view of others.

Leaders and adult supervisors should not be left alone with young people at the end of any activity. Start and finish times for coaching, training and/or other activities will be clearly stated. Parents are requested to collect their children as punctually as possible. If late collections occur, leaders/supervisors should remain in pairs until all participants have left. It is the responsibility of parents/guardians to make arrangements for the timely collection of young people in their charge. Consistent late collection may require alternative arrangements to be put in place.

If a parent is unavoidably delayed they should contact the club coach or one of the Junior Committee whose contact numbers will be provided to parents at the beginning of the year. In the event that no contact is made with the club/Junior Committee, the supervisor will attempt to contact the parent using the contact number(s) provided by them on the completed Consent Form. If there is no answer, they will ask the child if there is another family member whom they can contact. If no contact can still be made, the supervisor plus another adult will wait with the child at the club or venue until the child has been collected by a parent or other adult nominated by the parent.

Children attending for club-organised coaching should let one of the adult supervisors know when they have arrived at the club – it is the responsibility of parents to ensure that children do this. When they are finished their coaching session and are leaving with the adult nominated to collect them, they (or the adult) should inform the supervisor that they are leaving. Under no circumstances should a child leave the club premises without informing the adult supervisor.

If a child suffers an injury or accident the parents/guardians will be informed and an Accident Report Form will be completed. Attendance records and records of any incidents or accidents that occur will be kept by the club.

Supervision of changing rooms if necessary (where children are very young or need special assistance), will only be in pairs of the appropriate gender.

The club welcomes and encourages parents who wish to stay and supervise sessions (for safety and supervision, not necessarily for their ‘technical’ expertise).

Parents should note that adequate adult supervision as described above is provided only at the following times:

- During your child’s allocated coaching period as part of the club’s Junior Coaching Programme  
- During any of the internal junior activities organized and run by the Junior Committee of the club  
- During any of the closed club tournaments run by the Junior Committee of the club  

The details of the times of the above-listed activities are available from any member of the Junior Committee. If you have any difficulty getting this information, please contact the Joint Hon. Sec. of the club (details on the club website or on the Notice Board).

We wish to make it clear that while there may be adults present in the club premises at other times, the club does not regard their presence as the provision of adequate adult supervision and it is not responsible for the safety and protection of your child outside of the specific activities listed above.

While the Club takes every reasonable measure to ensure the safety and protection of all its members including Junior members while they are on the premises, such measures do not extend to the provision of adequate adult supervision other than for the activities listed above. In that regard, it is the responsibility of each parent/guardian to ensure that their child is adequately supervised at all other times that they are on the club premises (including times when the child is receiving private coaching organized by the child’s parents).

The parents of all children taking part in any of the activities organized by the club will be required to complete and sign the relevant Consent Form.
