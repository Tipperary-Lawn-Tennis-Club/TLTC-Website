Parents/carers want to be able to celebrate the achievements of their children when taking part in sporting activities through photographs and sports organisations will also want to promote their activities to encourage increased participation. Tennis Ireland does not advocate the banning of photography, but recommends that it is subject to appropriate and proportionate safeguards being in place to ensure a safe sporting environment for children and young people.

TCLTC will ensure that all necessary steps are taken to protect children and young people from the inappropriate use of their images in resources and media publications, on the internet and elsewhere.

GLTC have developed this policy in relation to the use of images of athletes on their websites and in other publications. The Club will make decisions about the type of images they consider suitable and that appropriately represent the sport, without putting children at increased risk.

Parents are required to support this policy.

When assessing the potential risks in the use of images of athletes, the most important factor is the potential of inappropriate use of images of children.

**GLTC adopt the following principles:**
- The interests and welfare of children taking part in sporting activities is paramount  
- Children and their parents/carers have a right to decide whether their photograph is taken, and how those images may be used  
- Children and their parents/carers must provide written consent for their images to be taken and used  
- Consider using models or illustrations if you are promoting an activity  
- Avoid the use of the first name and surname of individuals in a photograph. This reduces the risk of inappropriate, unsolicited attention from people within and outside the sport  

**Rules to remember are**:

- If the child is named, avoid using their photograph  
- If a photograph is used, avoid naming the child  
- Ask for parental permission to use an image of a young person. This ensures that parents are aware of the way the image of their child is representing the sport. A Parental Permission Form is one way of achieving this  
- Only use images of children in suitable dress to reduce the risk of inappropriate use. With regard to the actual content it is difficult to specify exactly what is appropriate given the wide diversity of sports. The content of the photograph should focus on the activity not on a particular child and should avoid full face and body shots.  
- Create a recognised procedure for reporting the use of inappropriate images to reduce the risks to children. Follow your child protection procedures, ensuring both your sports child protection officer and the Social Services and/or Police are informed.  


- Establish the type of images that appropriately represent the sport for the Web and other media  
- Think about the level of consideration you give to the use of images of children in other publications, for example, the processes involved in choosing appropriate images for the newsletter or magazine. Apply an increased level of consideration to the images of children and young people used in the website.  


**Guidelines for Use of Photographic Filming Equipment at Sporting Events**

- We will provide a clear brief about what is considered appropriate in terms of content and behaviour, including the displaying of notices at each event  
- Issue the photographer with identification which must be worn at all times  
- Inform children and parents that a photographer will be in attendance at an event and ensure they consent to both the taking and publication of films or photographs  
- Do not allow unsupervised access to children or one to one photo sessions at events  
- If parents or other spectators are intending to photograph or video at an event, they should also be made aware of your expectations  
- Spectators should be asked to register at an event if they wish to use photographic equipment  
- Children and parents should be informed that if they have concerns they can report these to the organiser  
- Concerns regarding inappropriate or intrusive photography should be reported to the event organiser or official and recorded in the same manner as any other child protection concern  

- **Professional photographers/filming/video operators** wishing to record the event should seek accreditation with the event organiser by producing their professional identification for the details to be recorded. Ideally, they should request this at least *(set number of days)* working days before the event.  
- **Students or amateur photographers/film/video operators** wishing to record the event should seek accreditation with the event organiser by producing their student or club registration card and a letter from the club/educational establishment outlining their motive for attending the event.  

**Accreditation procedure:**
- Professionals should register prior to the event and their identification details be recorded. Ideally they should be:
  - Name and address of the person using the camera  
  - Names of subjects (if specific)  
  - The reason or use the images are being or intended to be put to  
  - Signed declaration that the information provided is valid and that the images will only be used for the reasons given  

- A clear brief about what is considered appropriate in terms of content and behaviour should be issued. It may include a list of any areas where photographic and recording equipment including mobile phones is forbidden under all circumstances (e.g. changing rooms, toilet areas).  

- The recommended wording is:  
  > *In line with the recommendation in the Name of Governing Body Policy, the promoters of this event request that any person wishing to engage in any video, zoom or close range photography should register their details with staff at the tournament office before carrying out any such photography. The promoter reserves the right to decline entry to any person unable to meet or abide by the promoter's conditions.*
- If you are concerned about any photography taking place at this event, please contact the tournament officer staff who will be pleased to discuss this matter with you.
