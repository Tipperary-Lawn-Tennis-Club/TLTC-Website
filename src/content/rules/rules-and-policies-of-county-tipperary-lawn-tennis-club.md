The aim of Tipperary Lawn Tennis Club is to foster the tennis community and promote the joy of the game for players of all ages and skill levels. We offer 3 exceptional clay court facilities, maintained to offer the perfect playing conditions. We provide a welcoming environment where sportsmanship, health, and personal growth is encouraged. We want to inspire the passion for the game and uphold the tradition and integrity of the sport within our club.

**Court Etiquette**

1. Respect opponents (and umpires, referee and officials in tournaments)
2. Call balls fairly, if in doubt the ball was in. On clay courts the ball usually leaves a mark. Be prepared if asked to point to the exact bounce mark. If unhappy with a call on clay, ask politely to see the mark.
3. Avoid interrupting play on an adjoining court if possible.
4. Be silent during play.
5. Wait for your opponent to get into place before you serve. Avoid unnecessary delay when receiving serve.
6. Apologise for net ball shots.
7. Be respectful when celebrating. Be modest if you win the point.
8. Be calm if you lose a point.
9. Hand over balls to your opponent politely.
10. If there is interference from an adjoining court, stop play immediately and replay the point.
11. To avoid disharmony, one player, usually the server, should call out the score clearly. Any mistakes can be corrected at that point.
12. Avoid foot faulting, keep your feet behind the baseline when serving.
13. Spectators- applaud only good shots not mistakes. Do not help in line calls. When someone is unsure of their call it is never appropriate to call out or assist.
14. Shake hands after the match. Tomorrow is another day.
