TCLTC want to provide the best possible service.

**Our Commitment**

Electronic communication is essential for sharing club news and information with our members.

* Our communication will be timely, appropriate and related to club business.
* We use a range of electronic tools to communicate with our members.
* Our communication will protect members’ privacy, maintain clear boundaries and ensure that bullying and harassment does not occur.
* A webmaster will be appointed to provide accountability and control over material published on our club’s website and any related discussion groups or social media websites, such as Facebook, YouTube or Twitter.

**Website**

Our website will include:

* current information on competitions, social events, committees, policies, constitution, rules and by‐laws.
* No offensive content or photos will be published.
* We will seek feedback from members to improve the information available on the site.

**SMS & Email**

Committee members, coaches and team managers may use SMS and email to provide information about competition, training, club‐sanctioned social events and other club business, however:

* SMS messages should be short and about club/team matters
* email communication will be used when more information is required
* communication involving children will be directed through their parents.

**Social Media Websites**

* We treat all social media postings, blogs, status updates and tweets as public ‘comment’.
* Postings (written, photos or videos) will be family‐friendly and feature positive club news and events.
* No personal information about our members will be disclosed.
* No statements will be made that are misleading, false or likely to injure a person’s reputation.
