CTLTC’s Child Safeguarding Statement has been developed in line with requirements under the Children First Act 2015.  
CTLTC acknowledges the duty of care to safeguard and promote the welfare of children and is committed to ensuring safeguarding practice reflects statutory responsibilities, government guidance and complies with best practice and Tennis Ireland requirements.

Our Safeguarding policy recognises that the welfare and interests of children are paramount in all circumstances. It aims to ensure that all children:

- Have a positive and enjoyable experience of sport at CTLTC in a safe and child-centred environment  
- Are protected from abuse whilst participating in the club  

As part of our safeguarding policy CTLTC will:

- Promote and prioritise the safety and wellbeing of children and young people to participate in Tennis  
- Ensure everyone understands their roles and responsibilities in respect of safeguarding and is provided with appropriate learning opportunities to recognise, identify and respond to signs of abuse, neglect and other safeguarding concerns relating to children and young people  
- Ensure appropriate action is taken in the event of incidents/concerns of abuse and support provided to the individual/s who raise or disclose the concern  
- Ensure that confidential, detailed and accurate records of all safeguarding concerns are maintained and securely stored  
- Prevent the employment/deployment of unsuitable individuals  
- Ensure robust safeguarding arrangements and procedures are in operation  
- Ensure all policy and procedures are promoted and are mandatory for everyone involved in CTLTC. Failure to comply with the policy and procedures will be addressed without delay and may ultimately result in dismissal/exclusion from the organisation
